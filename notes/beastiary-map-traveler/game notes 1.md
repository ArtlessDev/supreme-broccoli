grid movement, the player can only dig/excavate forward
 - beasts expand on this

beasts can provide 
- movement
- vision 
- some third thing?



player begins on a wide platform, has to search for exit doors, similar to 'race to the finish' from ssb Melee where any exit will get you out but the farther you go the better the rewards




i have a screen setup with boilerplate, 

*TODO:*
- make player 
	- move any direction
	- excavate down only
- make tilemap appear
- randomize values for the 0s
	- *all 0s in the csv, will get a new value*
- placing blocks to create more path
